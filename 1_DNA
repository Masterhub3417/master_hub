#解答
input_dna = input('DNAを入力してください')
count_a = 0
count_t = 0
count_g = 0
count_c = 0

for count in input_dna:
    if count=="C":
        count_c +=1   #count_c +=1はcount_c+1を表す
    elif count=="G":
        count_g +=1
    elif count=="T":
        count_t +=1
    elif count=="A":
        count_a +=1
    
 
list_dna_count = [count_a, count_c, count_g, count_t]
print(list_dna_count)
